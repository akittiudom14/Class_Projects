MIPS Simulator (C, MIPS)
=

In this project, I created an instruction interpreter for a subset of MIPS code. It was good practice in C and required a very detailed understanding of MIPS code. In part1.c, I implemented the disassembler which takes the MIPS code and makes it human readable (printing out the MIPS instructions and the inputs). part2.c contains the simulator, which actually implements each MIPS instruction - including load and store. foo.s is a test file that tests each command.
